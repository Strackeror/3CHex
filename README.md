# PCHex
3DS Homebrew port of PKHex, A Pokémon save editor.

Currently just proof of concept.

# Build
You need the latest git version of ctrulib, found here: https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib
as this will NOT work with devkitPro's base ctrulib.

# Install
Copy the content of the "export" folder in your "homebrew" or "3ds" folder.

# Use
* Choose PCHex from the homebrew browser
* Choose your Pokémon game as the target game
* Choose the Pokémon from the box and slot selection screen
* You are able to change some but not all of the values at the moment
* Press Select to save the changes and Start to return
* Press Start again to exit
* Use CTRXplorer by d0k3 to move the "/3ds/PCHex/main" file to "/saveDataBackup/main"
* Use Save Managet by profi200 to import the save to your game
